### Noisebridge Gung Heap

Have a project you assembled around the space?  Take 20 minutes to write it down and upload the project files according to the pattern here.


### Why?

So others can follow in your footsteps, and so Noisebridge can share its work with the world at large.


#### How?

Use the `sample project` as a template.  

1. Download a `zip` file of this repository
    - Alternative: `fork` and `clone`
2. Choose a project name. 
    - Example: `your-project.md`
3. Copy the `sample.md` file into `your-project.md`
4. Make a directory with the same name `your-project`, and add your files to it
5. Zip the whole `gung-heap` folder into `gung-heap.zip` and send it to Trent
    - Alternative: `commit` and `push` your changes, then make a `pull request` from your `fork`
